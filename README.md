__This version of skitter is currently going through a major refactor and is not usable__
To experiment with the effect-based version of Skitter, please use /mathseay/skitter/releases/tag/v0.1.

# Skitter

Skitter is a component agnostic, reactive workflow system.

Skitter makes it possible to wrap arbitrary data processing applications into
_reactive components_.
These components can be combined into reactive workflows, which can process
data entering the system from the outside world.

# Getting Started

We are currently working on creating an easy way to deploy Skitter applications.
For now, please use
[this](https://soft.vub.ac.be/~mathsaey/artefacts/rebls-2018-evaluation.zip)
application as an example to get started.
