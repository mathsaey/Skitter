# Skitter Runtime

This library defines various reusable components that can be used by Skitter
runtime applications.
Note that this application is purely a library, it does not automatically start
any application on its own.

## Installation

Add the application as a dependency:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:skitter_runtime, in_umbrella: true}
  ]
end
```
